This site will be displayed on Heroku.

This site called commands_app is a site that displays subjects with useful commands.
For example users can select "sublime" and then see useful shortcuts that can be done when using Sublime.  There will also be a feature where users can sign up and login.  Once they are logged in and they revisit the site there will be a quiz question displayed that corresponds to the command that that user looked up the previous time he or she visited the site.  This is so users can review the command they previously referenced.
